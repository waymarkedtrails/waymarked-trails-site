""" Tables storing information derived from the cycling relations.
    
    The cycling net is saved in Segments. A segment is strictly linear and goes from 
    one intersection to the next, with no Segments crossing or touching it. A Segment
    can be composed of multiple OSM ways (or parts thereof in the case where there is
    an intersection in the middle of the way) but all ways must be members of exactly
    the same relation set and not change role within one relation.

    Intersections are OSM nodes that are start and end points of Segments. At the moment
    this is a purely virtual concept, there is no table storing Intersections.

    Routes describe the properties of the actual cycling relations. There is one route
    per relation.

    Route hierarchy describes the relation between the routes.

    For creation and update, order of operation is as follows:

    1. update of geometry and admin info for Segments
    2. update hierarchy
    3. update of Route table (note that some properties of a route may
       depend on its location, so the segments of each route must be known
       first)

    The actualy rendering information is computed seperately. This allows to use
    different rendering styles on the same table. For the moment there is only
    style_default.py.
