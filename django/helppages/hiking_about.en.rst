.. subpage:: about About the Map

This map shows sign-posted hiking routes around the world. It is based on data from the OpenStreetMap_ (OSM) project. OSM is a freely editable world map where anybody can participate. That means that this hiking map is by no means complete, but it also means that you can contribute by adding new routes and correcting mistakes in existing ones. To find out more about OpenStreetMap, see the `Beginner's Guide`_.

This map only provides an overlay with the hiking routes. It was designed for the OSM Mapnik map as base map but should work together with other online maps as well. Please, read the `Usage Policy`_ before using it on your own website.

.. subpage:: rendering Rendering OSM Data

Hiking routes in OSM should be entered as relations. How this works is described in detail on the `Walking Routes`_ tagging page in the OSM wiki. This map shows all relations that have at least the following tags:

::

    type = route|superroute
    route = foot|walking|hiking


Which route type is given makes no difference. The classification (and therefore the colour of the route in the map) is determined from the ``network`` tag. The symbol is guessed from the tags in the following order:

 1. Check for `localized rendering rules`_.
 2. Try to interpret the ``osmc:symbol`` tag. For details about which parts are understood, see `osmc:symbol rendering rules`_.
 3. If a ``ref`` tag exists, make a text label with the ``ref`` tag.
 4. If a ``name`` tag exists, derive a reference from that, first by using only upper-case letters and failing that by using the first letters of the name. 
    *Note for mapping: guessing a reference from the route name is essentially a hack to show something for incompletely tagged routes. Use an explicit route reference wherever possible.*
 5. Give up. 

The map also supports `relation hierarchies`_.

Guideposts_ must have the following tags:

::

    tourism=information
    information=guidepost
    name=<name>
    ele=<altitude>

If both ``name`` and ``ele`` are missing, the guidepost will appear unnamed and gray.

.. subpage:: rendering/hierarchies Relation Hierarchies

The map also supports nested relations, i.e. relations that contain relations themselves. At the moment there are two main uses for such relation hierarchies: they are either used to split up very long routes (e.g. E1_) or they are used to avoid duplicated work where two routes go along the same way (see, for example, the Swiss `Via Francigena`_ which is part of the European `Via Romea Francigena`_). In the first case the sub-relations are not complete routes themselves and should therefore not be shown on a map.

How exactly a subrelation is treated by the renderer depends on the network tag:

  * If parent and child relation share the same network tag, the child relation is taken to be just a stage of the parent relation. Thus, its route is added to the parent relation and the child relation is not shown in the map.
  * If the network tag of parent and child relation are different, the relation are assumed to be independent. The route of the child relation is added to the parent and both relations are shown in the map.

*Note:* you can always inspect subrelations via the route browser. Simply select the parent relation and a selectable list of its subrelations is shown.

.. _`Via Romea Francigena`: /route/Via%20Romea%20Francigena

.. subpage:: rendering/osmc_symbol osmc:symbol Tag

The osmc:symbol tag provides a way to describe in a machine-readable way route symbols in simple geometric shapes like they are found in some European countries (and especially in Germany). The hiking map only supports a subset of what is described on the Wiki page. In order to be rendered on the map, the tag must have the following format:


::

  osmc:symbol=waycolor:background:foreground:text:textcolor

Waycolor must be there but is ignored for this map. Foreground may not be empty, a second foreground is not supported. Text and text color can be omitted. There is a `list of foreground and background symbols rendered in this map`_ available.

*Note:* the older version of the map accepted the ``foreground`` part to be empty. This is no longer supported because the ``osmc:symbol`` tag should only be used to describe geometric shapes. Without the foreground shape, the symbol describes a simple reference of the way and, for the sake of clarity will be rendered as such. Local exceptions may be possible.

.. subpage:: rendering/local_rules Localized Rendering

There are a lot of different systems to mark hiking paths out there. While the map attempts to use the most general tags to give them a decent rendering, it is bound to fail for certain systems, especially for networks of hiking paths. To accommodate these systems, the map can be localised for regions where the standard rendering is insufficient.

Below is a list of regions that use special map symbols. In order to have your own region rendered in a special way, read the hints at the end of the page.

Switzerland
===========

Switzerland has a very extensive network of marked hiking paths that is stretched out over the entire country. The network is a node network where named guideposts function as the nodes. All paths are marked consistently according to their difficulty. The map shows these paths in red with the line pattern marking the difficulty:

|          | Requires a reasonable level of fitness  | ``osmc:symbol=red:[...]``    |
|          | and surefootedness.                     |                              |
|          | Fear of heights might pose a problem.   |                              |
+----------+-----------------------------------------+------------------------------+
||routealp|| *Alpine path*, marked with |whiteblue|  | ``network=lwn``              |
|          |                                         |                              |
|          | Requires mountaineering experience and  | ``osmc:symbol=blue:[...]``   |
|          | appropriate gear                        |                              |
+----------+-----------------------------------------+------------------------------+

Note that on top of this network there are a number of national and regional routes which are shown in the normal way.

For more information about tagging hiking paths in Switzerland in OSM see: `Swiss Hiking Network on the OSM Wiki`_.

United Kingdom
==============

The classification of `UK long-distance paths`_ (those tagged with ``network=uk_ldp``) depends on the ``operator`` tag. Relations with ``operator=National Trails`` are shown as national trails, all other relations appear as regional routes.

Relations with a ``network=lwn/rwn/nwn/iwn`` tag are handled as usual.

Czech Republic
==============

The country uses a trail marking standard based on a set of 7 symbols in 4 different colors. For a description see the `Czech tagging page`_ (Czech only).

When a ``kct_*`` tag is available it is preferred over any ``osmc:symbol`` tag. In addition, the route is reclassified if no valid network tag can be found. Routes with ``kct_red=major`` become national routes, other ``kct_*=major`` are classified as regional.

Note: Symbols are derived from the excellent vector graphics by Radomir.cernoch as found in the OSM wiki.

Slovakia
========

Slovakia uses the same trail marking standard as the Czech Republic. However, the tagging schema is slightly different, see the `Slovakian hiking page`_.

All routes with a tag ``operator=KST`` are tagged according to that schema. As routes in Slovakia should come with a valid network tag, there is no reclassification performed.

Germany
=======

Fränkischer Albverein
---------------------

The network around Nuremberg is quite dense, therefore regional routes tagged with ``operator=Fränkischer Albverein`` will appear on zoom levels lower than usual.
