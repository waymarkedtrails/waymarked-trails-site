    osm: |
        It is based
        on data from the [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) (OSM)
        project. OSM is a freely editable world map where anybody can
        participate. Which means that it is by no means complete,
        but it also means that you can contribute by adding new routes and
        correcting mistakes in existing ones. To find out more about
        OpenStreetMap, see the
        [Beginner's guide](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners%27_Guide).

    title: Rendering OSM data
    hikingroutes: |
        Hiking routes in OSM need to be entered as relations. How this works is
        described in detail on the tagging page about
        [walking routes](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Walking_Routes)
        in the OSM wiki. This map shows relations that have at least the
        following tags:

            type = route|superroute
            route = foot|walking|hiking
    cyclingroutes: |
        Cycling routes in OSM need to be entered as relations. How this works is
        described in detail on the tagging page about
        [cycling routes](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Cycle_routes) in the
        OSM wiki. This map shows all relations that have at least the following tags:

            type = route|superroute
            route = bicycle
    mtbroutes: |
        Mountain-biking routes follow the same tagging schema as cycling routes
        which is described in detail on the OSM wiki page about
        [cycling routes](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Cycle_routes).
        Relations that have the following tags are recognized as MTB routes:

            type = route|superroute
            route = mtb
    skatingroutes: |
        Sign-posted skating routes should be tagged like any other route relation.
        For the tagging understood by this map, have a look at the wiki page about
        [Swiss inline skating routes](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Switzerland/InlineNetwork).
        To be recognized as a skating route, the following tags need to be present:

            type = route|superroute
            route = inline_skating

    classification:
        The classification (and therefore the colour of the route in the map) is
        determined from the `network` tag.
    hikingsymbol: |
        The symbol is guessed from the tags in the following order:

        1. Check for [localized rendering rules](rendering/local_rules).
        2. Try to interpret the `osmc:symbol` tag. For details about which parts
           are understood, see [osmc:symbol rendering rules](rendering/osmc).
        3. If a `ref` tag exists, make a text label with the `ref` tag.
        4. If a `name` tag exists, derive a reference from that, first by using
           only upper-case letters and failing that by using the first letters
           of the name.
        5. Give up.
    labels: |
        The label for each route is guessed from the tags in the following order:

        1. If a `ref` tag exists, make a text label with the `ref` tag.
        2. If a `name` tag exists, derive a reference from that, first by using
           only upper-case letters and failing that by using the first letters of the name.
        3. Give up.
    hierarchy: |
        The map also supports [relation hierarchies](rendering/hierarchies).
    guideposts: |
        [Guideposts](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:information%3Dguidepost)
        are recognized if they have the following tags:

            tourism=information
            information=guidepost
            name=<name>
            ele=<altitude>

        `tourism` and `information` are mandatory. If both `name` and `ele` are
        missing, the guidepost will appear unnamed and gray.

hierarchies:
    title: Relation hierarchies
    text: |
        The map also supports nested relations, i.e. relations that contain
        relations themselves. At the moment there are two main uses for such
        relation hierarchies: they are either used to split up very long routes
        (e.g. [E1](/route/European%20walking%20route%20E1)) or they are used
        to avoid duplicated work where two routes go along the same way (see
        for example, the Swiss [Via Francigena](/route/Via%20Francigena,%20Swiss%20part)
        which is part of the European [Via Romea Francigena](/route/Via%20Romea%20Francigena)).
        In the first case the sub-relations are not complete routes
        themselves and should therefore not be shown on a map.

        How exactly a subrelation is treated by the renderer depends on the
        `network` tag:

        * If parent and child relation share the same network tag, the child
          relation is taken to be just a stage of the parent relation. Thus,
          its route is added to the parent relation and the child relation is
          not shown in the map.
        * If the network tag of parent and child relation are different, the
          relation are assumed to be independent. The route of the child relation
          is added to the parent and both relations are shown in the map.

        *Note:* you can always inspect subrelations via the route browser. Simply
        select the parent relation and a selectable list of its subrelations is shown.
osmc:
    title: The osmc:symbol tag
    text: |
        The osmc:symbol tag provides a way to describe in a machine-readable way
        route symbols in simple geometric shapes like they are found in some
        European countries (and especially in Germany). The hiking map only
        supports a subset of what is described on the Wiki page. In order to
        be rendered on the map, the tag must have the following format:

            osmc:symbol=waycolor:background:foreground:text:textcolor

        `waycolor` must be there but is ignored for this map. `foreground` may not
        be empty, a second foreground is not supported. `text` and `textcolor` can
        be omitted. There is a
        [list of foreground and background symbols rendered in this map](osmc_legende)
        available.

        *Note:* the older version of the map accepted the `foreground` part to
        be empty. This is no longer supported because the `osmc:symbol` tag
        should only be used to describe geometric shapes. Without the foreground
        shape, the symbol describes a simple reference of the way and, for the
        sake of clarity will be rendered as such. Local exceptions may be possible.
hikinglocal:
    title: Localized rendering
    text: |
        There are a lot of different systems to mark hiking paths around the world. While the
        map attempts to use the most general tags to give them a decent rendering, it is
        bound to fail for certain systems, especially for networks of hiking paths. To
        accommodate these systems, the map can be localised for regions where the
        standard rendering is insufficient.

        Below is a list of regions that use special map symbols. In order to have your
        own region rendered in a special way, read the hints at the end of the page.
    swiss: |
        ## Switzerland

        Switzerland has an extensive network of marked hiking paths covering the
        entire country. The network is a node network where named guideposts function
        as the nodes. All paths are marked consistently according to their difficulty.
        The map shows these paths in red with the line pattern marking the difficulty

        * ![red line](route_std.png) *hiking path*, marked with ![diamond](yellow_diamond.png). Tagged with `network=lwn` and `osmc:symbol=yellow:[...]`.
        * ![dashed line](route_mnt.png) *mountain path*, marked with ![white-red-white](white_red_white.png). Tagged with `network=lwn` and  `osmc:symbol=red:[...]`.
        * ![dotted line](route_alp.png) *alpine path*, marked with ![white-blue-white](white_blue_white.png). Tagged with `network=lwn` and  `osmc:symbol=blue:[...]`.

        Note that on top of this network there are a number of national and regional
        routes which are shown in the normal way.

        For more information about tagging hiking paths in Switzerland in OSM see:
        [Swiss hiking network](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Switzerland/HikingNetwork).
    uk: |
        ## United Kingdom

        The classification of [UK long-distance paths](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_United_Kingdom_Long_Distance_Paths)
        (those tagged with `network=uk_ldp`) depends on the `operator` tag. Relations
        with `operator=National Trails` are shown as national trails, all other relations
        appear as regional routes.

        Relations with a `network=lwn/rwn/nwn/iwn` tag are handled as usual.
    czech: |
        ## Czech Republic

        The country uses a trail marking standard based on a set of 7 symbols in 4 different
        colors. For a description see the [Czech tagging page](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Czech_Republic/Editing_Standards_and_Conventions#Doporu.C4.8Den.C3.A9_typy_cest) (Czech only).

        When a `kct_*` tag is available it is preferred over any `osmc:symbol` tag.
        In addition, the route is reclassified if no valid network tag can be found. Routes
        with `kct_red=major` become national routes, other `kct_*=major` are classified as
        regional.

    slovakia: |
        ## Slovakia

        Slovakia uses the same trail marking standard as the Czech Republic. However,
        the tagging schema is slightly different, see the
        [Slovakian hiking page](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Slovakia/Hiking_routes).

        All routes with a tag `operator=KST` are tagged according to that schema. As
        routes in Slovakia should come with a valid network tag, there is no
        reclassification performed.
    hungary: |
        ## Hungary

        Hungary also use a system with a fixed set of symbols in different colors. These
        are marked with their own tag [jel](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:jel).
        The tag is preferred over any `osmc:symbol` tag.
    germany: |
        ## Germany

        ### Fränkischer Albverein

        The network around Nuremberg is quite dense, therefore regional routes tagged
        with `operator=Fränkischer Albverein` will appear on zoom levels lower than usual.

    title: Technical details
    general: |
        The overlay is updated once a day. The date in the upper left corner shows
        the last update. Normally, contributions until around midnight are taken
        into account. Updates of the underlying Mapnik map are not within this
        site's control. Depending on the current load of the OSM server they take
        between a minute and a few days.

        The machine runs standard Debian Linux with a toolchain consisting of
        [osmosis](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis),
        [Postgresql](http://www.postgresql.org) and [Mapnik 2.0](http://www.mapnik.org).
