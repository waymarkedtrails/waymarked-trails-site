    osm: |
        The routes are overlayed on the standard OpenStreetMap and optionally a hillshading layer. The route map is generated from
        data from the [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) (OSM)
        project. OSM is a freely editable world map where anybody can
        participate. Which means that it is by no means complete,
        but it also means that you can contribute by adding new routes and
        correcting mistakes in existing ones. To find out more about
        OpenStreetMap, see the
        [Beginner's guide](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners%27_Guide).

    title: Rendering OSM data
    hikingroutes: |
        Hiking routes in OSM need to be entered as relations. How this works is
        described in detail on the tagging page about
        [walking routes](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Walking_Routes)
        in the OSM wiki. This map shows relations that have at least the
        following tags:

            type = route|superroute
            route = foot|walking|hiking
    cyclingroutes: |
        Cycling routes in OSM need to be entered as relations. How this works is
        described in detail on the tagging page about
        [cycling routes](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Cycle_routes) in the
        OSM wiki. This map shows all relations that have at least the following tags:

            type = route|superroute
            route = bicycle

        Mountain-biking routes are displayed on a separate [MTB-map](http://mtb.waymarkedtrails.org/en/).
    mtbroutes: |
        Mountain-biking routes follow the same tagging schema as cycling routes
        which is described in detail on the OSM wiki page about
        [cycling routes](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Cycle_routes).
        Relations that have the following tags are recognized as MTB routes:

            type = route|superroute
            route = mtb

        Regular cycling routes are displayed on the [cycling map](http://cycling.waymarkedtrails.org/en/).
    skatingroutes: |
        Sign-posted skating routes should be tagged like any other route relation.
        For the tagging understood by this map, have a look at the wiki page about
        [Swiss inline skating routes](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Switzerland/InlineNetwork).
        To be recognized as a skating route, the following tags need to be present:

            type = route|superroute
            route = inline_skates
    ridingroutes: |
        Sign-posted horse riding routes should be tagged like any other route relation.
        For details see [the route page in the OSM wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation:route).
        To be recognized as a horse riding route, the following tags need to be present:

            type = route|superroute
            route = horse
    sloperoutes: |
        Sign-posted slopes are ways with the piste:type tags.
        To be recognized as a slope, the following tags need to be present for ways:

            piste:type = downhill|nordic|sled|hike|sleigh

        For relations, the following tags need to be present:

            type = route|superroute
            route = ski|piste
            piste:type = downhill|nordic|sled|hike|sleigh

    slopeclassification: |
        The classification of ski (downhill) slopes is
        determined from the `piste:difficulty` tag, and used
        for the colour in the rendering.
    classification: |
        A `route` tag with multiple values is supported when they are separated by
        semicolon without any surrounding spaces.
        The classification (and therefore the colour of the route in the map) is
        determined from the `network` tag.
    slopemaplabels: |
        The label for ski (downhill) routes is "guessed" from the tags in the following order:

        1. If a `piste:ref` tag exists, make a text label with the `piste:ref` tag.
        2. If a `piste:name` tag exists, derive a reference from that, first by using
           only upper-case letters and failing that by using the first letters
           of the name.
        3. If a `ref` tag exists, make a text label with the `ref` tag.
        4. If it is a relation and a `name` tag exists, derive a reference from that, first by using
           only upper-case letters and failing that by using the first letters
           of the name.
        5. Give up.

        Nordic slopes are marked with a sign just showing their colour, if a colour tag is present.
    hikinglabels: |
        The label for each route is "guessed" from the tags in the following order:

        1. Check for [localized rendering rules](rendering/hikinglocal).
        2. Try to interpret the `osmc:symbol` tag. For details about which parts
           are understood, see [osmc:symbol rendering rules](rendering/osmc).
        3. If a `ref` tag exists, make a text label with the `ref` tag.
        4. If a `name` tag exists, derive a reference from that, first by using
           only upper-case letters and failing that by using the first letters
           of the name.
        5. Give up.
    labels: |
        The label for each route is "guessed" from the tags in the following order:

        1. If a `ref` tag exists, make a text label with the `ref` tag.
        2. If a `name` tag exists, derive a reference from that, first by using
           only upper-case letters and failing that by using the first letters of the name.
        3. Give up.
    hierarchy: |
        The map also supports [relation hierarchies](rendering/hierarchies).
    guideposts: |
        [Guideposts](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:information%3Dguidepost)
        are recognized by the following tags:

            tourism=information
            information=guidepost
            name=<name>
            ele=<altitude>

        `tourism` and `information` are mandatory. `name` and `ele` can be omitted.
hierarchies:
    title: Relation hierarchies
    text: |
        The map also supports nested relations, i.e. relations that contain
        relations themselves. These hierarchies are used in two different ways
        in the OSM database: they are either used to split up very long routes
        (e.g. [E1](http://hiking.waymarkedtrails.org/route/European%20walking%20route%20E1)) or they are used
        to avoid duplicated work where two routes go along the same way (see
        for example, the Swiss [Via Francigena](http://hiking.waymarkedtrails.org/route/Via%20Francigena,%20Swiss%20part)
        which is part of the European [Via Romea Francigena](http://hiking.waymarkedtrails.org/route/Via%20Romea%20Francigena)).
        In the first case the sub-relations are not complete routes
        themselves and should therefore not be shown on the map independently.

        How exactly a subrelation is treated by the renderer depends on the
        `network` tag:

        * If parent and child relation share the same network tag, the child
          relation is taken to be just a stage of the parent relation. Thus,
          its route is added to the parent relation and the child relation is
          not shown in the map.
        * If the network tag of parent and child relation are different, the
          relation are assumed to be independent. The route of the child relation
          is added to the parent and both relations are shown in the map.

        *Note:* you can always inspect subrelations via the route browser. Simply
        select the parent relation and a selectable list of its subrelations is shown.
osmc:
    title: The osmc:symbol tag
    text: |
        The `osmc:symbol` tag provides a way to describe in a machine-readable way
        route symbols in simple geometric shapes like they are found in some
        European countries (and especially in Germany). The map only
        supports a subset of what is described on the Wiki page. In order to
        be rendered on the map, the tag must have the following format:

            osmc:symbol=waycolor:background:foreground:text:textcolor

        `waycolor` must be there but is ignored for this map.
        A second foreground is not supported. `text` and `textcolor` can
        be omitted. There is a
        [list of foreground and background symbols rendered in this map](osmc_legende)
        available.

hikinglocal:
    title: Localized rendering
    text: |
        There are a lot of different systems to mark hiking paths around the world. While the
        map attempts to use the most general tags to give them a decent rendering, it is
        bound to fail for certain systems, especially for networks of hiking paths. To
        accommodate these systems, the map can be localised for regions where the
        standard rendering is insufficient.

        Below is a list of regions that use special map symbols. In order to have your
        own region rendered in a special way, read the hints at the end of the page.
    swiss: |
        ## Switzerland

        Switzerland has an extensive network of marked hiking paths covering the
        entire country. The network is a node network where named guideposts function
        as the nodes. All paths are marked consistently according to their difficulty.
        The map shows these paths in red with the line pattern marking the difficulty

        * ![red line](route_std.png) *hiking path*, marked with ![diamond](yellow_diamond.png). Tagged with `network=lwn` and `osmc:symbol=yellow:[...]`.
        * ![dashed line](route_mnt.png) *mountain path*, marked with ![white-red-white](white_red_white.png). Tagged with `network=lwn` and `osmc:symbol=red:[...]`.
        * ![dotted line](route_alp.png) *alpine path*, marked with ![white-blue-white](white_blue_white.png). Tagged with `network=lwn` and `osmc:symbol=blue:[...]`.

        Note that on top of this network there are a number of national and regional
        routes which are shown in the normal way.

        For more information about tagging hiking paths in Switzerland in OSM see:
        [Swiss hiking network](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Switzerland/HikingNetwork).
    uk: |
        ## United Kingdom

        The classification of [UK long-distance paths](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_United_Kingdom_Long_Distance_Paths)
        (those tagged with `network=uk_ldp`) depends on the `operator` tag. Relations
        with `operator=National Trails` are shown as national trails, all other relations
        appear as regional routes.

        Relations with a `network=lwn/rwn/nwn/iwn` tag are handled as usual.
    czech: |
        ## Czech Republic

        The country uses a trail marking standard based on a set of 7 symbols in 4 different
        colors. For a description see the [Czech tagging page](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Czech_Republic/Editing_Standards_and_Conventions#Doporu.C4.8Den.C3.A9_typy_cest) (Czech only).

        When a `kct_*` tag is available it is preferred over any `osmc:symbol` tag.
        In addition, the route is reclassified if no valid network tag can be found. Routes
        with `kct_red=major` become national routes, other `kct_*=major` are classified as
        regional.
    slovakia: |
        ## Slovakia

        Slovakia uses the same trail marking standard as the Czech Republic. However,
        the tagging schema is slightly different, see the
        [Slovakian hiking page](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Slovakia/Hiking_routes).

        All routes with a tag `operator=KST` are tagged according to that schema. As
        routes in Slovakia should come with a valid network tag, there is no
        reclassification performed.
    hungary: |
        ## Hungary

        Hungary also uses a system with a fixed set of symbols in different colors. These
        are marked with their own tag [jel](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:jel).
        The tag is preferred over any `osmc:symbol` tag.
    germany: |
        ## Germany

        ### Fränkischer Albverein

        The network around Nuremberg is quite dense, therefore regional routes tagged
        with `operator=Fränkischer Albverein` will appear on zoom levels lower than usual.
    ukcycle: |
        ## United Kingdom

        ### Norwich

        Norwich uses a system of color-coded routes. Routes tagged with
        `operator=Norwich City Council` are marked with a coloured square according
        to the `colour` tag.
elevationprofiles:
    title: Elevation profiles
    general: |
        The elevation profiles are made with elevation data from the [ASTER global digital elevation model (GDEM) version 2](http://asterweb.jpl.nasa.gov/gdem.asp), the "ele" tag in OpenStreetMap is not taken into account, nor are tunnels and bridges. ASTER GDEM is a product of METI and NASA.
        
        If the route has more than two end points or consists of more than one segment, no profile will be rendered. The direction of the profile follows the route west-east or north-south. If routes had elements with roles such as "start" and "goal", and/or were listed continuously from start to goal, we might be able determine direction from the route relation itself. You might want to bear those things in mind if mapping routes on OpenStreetMap.
        
        There are holes, so called "voids" for which we have no elevation data, these are visualized with holes in the elevation profile line.
        
        Beware that while ASTER version 2 is probably the best free global DEM, it does have its limitations both when it comes to accuracy and coverage, see their [validation summary report](http://www.jspacesystems.or.jp/ersdac/GDEM/ver2Validation/Summary_GDEM2_validation_report_final.pdf) for more information. The inaccuracies are further exacerbated by the inaccuracy of the OSM data, [a smoothing technique](https://github.com/lonvia/waymarked-trails-site/commit/602e12f38bfdc50c7e07bd3f44e080d72bcbb2a2) that we apply, and the resolution of the profile which becomes lower the longer the route is.
technical:
    title: Technical details
    general: |
        The route overlay is updated minutely and is normally 10-15 minutes behind the
        OSM server. The date in the upper left corner shows
        the last update. Updates of the underlying Mapnik map are not within this
        site's control. Depending on the current load of the OSM server they take
        between a minute and a few days.

        The machine runs standard [Debian Linux](http://www.debian.org/) with a toolchain consisting of
        [osmosis](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis),
        [Postgresql](http://www.postgresql.org) and [Mapnik 2.0](http://www.mapnik.org).
        [osgende](https://github.com/lonvia/osgende) takes care of some postprocessing
        on the database before rendering. The website uses the
